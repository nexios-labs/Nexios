#### Philosophy  
Nexios is designed to be minimal, fast, and flexible, drawing inspiration from Express.js. It avoids unnecessary complexity, letting developers build applications with ease while keeping full control. Unlike traditional frameworks that enforce strict patterns, Nexios is modular, lightweight, and ORM-agnostic.

### With Django  
- **Philosophy**: Django is a full-featured framework that follows a "batteries-included" approach, enforcing a strong structure with built-in ORM, authentication, and admin panels. Nexios, on the other hand, is minimal and gives developers more freedom to choose their tools.  
- **Performance**: Django is robust but can be heavy due to its monolithic nature. Nexios is lightweight and optimized for performance.  
- **Flexibility**: Django enforces its ORM and templating system. Nexios is ORM-agnostic and allows developers to structure projects however they prefer.  
- **Use Case**: Django is great for large-scale applications with strict conventions. Nexios is ideal for developers who prefer a minimal framework that doesn't impose restrictions.

### With FastAPI  
- **Philosophy**: FastAPI is designed for high-performance applications, especially APIs, using async capabilities with Pydantic for validation. Nexios is also minimal and fast but doesn't enforce async programming.  
- **Performance**: FastAPI is highly optimized for speed with ASGI. Nexios is lightweight but follows a more traditional request-response cycle like Flask.  
- **Flexibility**: FastAPI enforces type annotations and validation. Nexios gives developers full freedom without enforcing strict typing.  
- **Use Case**: FastAPI is best for high-performance APIs with async support. Nexios is suited for developers who want an Express.js-style framework in Python with minimal setup.

### With Flask  
- **Philosophy**: Flask is a micro-framework that gives developers the flexibility to build applications with minimal setup. Nexios follows a similar philosophy but is designed to be even more intuitive and modular.  
- **Performance**: Both Nexios and Flask are lightweight, but Nexios is optimized for speed and modularity.  
- **Flexibility**: Flask has extensions for added functionality. Nexios takes this further by supporting plugins while keeping the core lightweight.  
- **Use Case**: Flask is good for small to medium applications. Nexios is great for developers who want a more modern and flexible alternative without unnecessary boilerplate.
