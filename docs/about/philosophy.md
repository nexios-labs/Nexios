# Philosophy

If Express.js and Python had a wild night of coding, Nexios would be the result—a framework that brings Express.js's simplicity to Python's elegant ecosystem.

## Core Principles

### 1. Developer Freedom First
We believe developers should be in charge. No magic, no unnecessary fluff—just clean, modular, and enjoyable development.

### 2. Minimalism with Power
Like Express.js, we keep the core lightweight but powerful. Install, import, and start coding. No complex configurations required.

### 3. True Python Spirit
While we love Express.js's approach, we're Pythonic at heart. Everything in Nexios feels natural to Python developers.

## Framework Comparisons

### vs FastAPI
* **Philosophy**: FastAPI is built for high-performance async APIs with strong typing. Nexios focuses on simplicity and developer freedom.
* **Performance**: Let's be honest—FastAPI is faster. We're newer and still optimizing, but we're proud of our current performance.
* **Use Case**: Choose FastAPI for pure API projects needing maximum performance. Choose Nexios when you want an Express.js-like experience in Python.

### vs Django
* **Philosophy**: Django includes everything out of the box. Nexios lets you choose your tools.
* **Structure**: Django enforces project structure. Nexios gives you freedom to organize your way.
* **Use Case**: Choose Django for large projects needing full features. Choose Nexios for flexibility and simplicity.

### vs Flask
* **Philosophy**: We share Flask's minimalist spirit but add modern tooling and Express.js-inspired patterns.
* **Development**: Both prioritize developer experience, but Nexios adds built-in features Flask typically needs extensions for.
* **Use Case**: Choose Flask for ultra-minimal projects. Choose Nexios for a more featured yet flexible experience.

## Our Promise

We promise to:
- Keep things simple
- Stay transparent about our capabilities
- Never sacrifice developer experience for marketing
- Maintain our Express.js inspiration while being truly Pythonic
