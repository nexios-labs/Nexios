    title: Async by Design
    details: Nexios is built from the ground up with native async support, making it perfect for I/O-bound operations like API calls, database access, or file handling. Every route, middleware, and lifecycle hook supports async/await, allowing you to write clean, non-blocking code that scales naturally under heavy loads.

    title: Lightning-Fast Performance 
    details: Nexios is ultra-lightweight and avoids bloated abstractions. It uses minimal layers between your code and the core ASGI server, ensuring requests are processed with blazing speed. The focus on performance makes it a great choice for microservices, APIs, and real-time apps where low latency matters.

    title: Built-in WebSocket Support 
    details: Real-time communication is a first-class citizen in Nexios. With direct WebSocket routing and connection lifecycle handling, you can build features like live chats, notifications, or real-time dashboards without external plugins. Managing WebSocket events is just as simple as defining routes.
