### Quick Start

#### Simple Hello World

Your first Nexios application can be as simple as:

```python
from nexios import get_application

app = get_application()

@app.get("/")
async def hello(request, response):
    return response.json({"message": "Hello, World!"})


```

#### Adding Middleware

Enhance your application with middleware:

```python
from nexios import get_application

async def JSONMiddleware(request, response, next):
    request.json = process_json(request.body)
    return await next()

app = get_application()
app.use(JSONMiddleware)

@app.get("/")
async def index(request, response):
    return response.json({"message": "Welcome to Nexios!"})
```

#### Creating Routes with Parameters

Define routes with dynamic parameters:

```python
@app.get("/users/{user_id}")
async def get_user(request, response):
    user_id = request.path_params["user_id"]
    return response.json({"user_id": user_id})
```

#### Working with Different HTTP Methods

Handle various HTTP methods with ease:

```python
@app.post("/users")
async def create_user(request, response):
    user_data = await request.json
    # Process user data
    return response.json({"created": True, "user": user_data})

@app.put("/users/{user_id}")
async def update_user(request, response):
    user_id = request.path_params["user_id"]
    updates = await request.json
    # Update user with ID
    return response.json({"updated": True, "id": user_id})

@app.delete("/users/{user_id}")
async def delete_user(request, response):
    user_id = request.path_params["user_id"]
    # Delete user with ID
    return response.json({"deleted": True, "id": user_id})
```

#### Using Pydantic for Data Validation

Leverage Pydantic for request validation:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import Optional

class UserCreate(BaseModel):
    username: str
    email: str
    full_name: Optional[str] = None

@app.post("/users")
async def create_user(request, response):
    data = await request.json
    user = UserCreate(**data)
    return response.json({"created": user.dict()})
```

#### Application Lifecycle Events

Handle startup and shutdown events:

```python
@app.on_startup
async def initialize_resources():
    print("Application starting up!")
    # Initialize database connections, etc.

@app.on_shutdown
async def cleanup_resources():
    print("Application shutting down!")
    # Close connections, free resources, etc.
```
