Sure, Dunamis. Here's a basic `concept.md` file for your Nexios documentation using **VitePress** syntax. This will explain the **concept of Nexios**, keeping it clear and dev-friendly:

# Concept

Nexios is a modern, async-first Python web framework built to prioritize simplicity, speed, and developer experience. Inspired by Express.js, it aims to eliminate unnecessary boilerplate and give full control back to the developer.

## Why Nexios?

Most Python frameworks are either:
- **Too heavy** (like Django with hidden magic), or
- **Too opinionated** (like FastAPI with excessive decorators and pydantic dependencies).

Nexios finds the balance — it's:
- Lightweight  
- Explicit  
- Fast (ASGI-native)  
- ORM-agnostic  
- Middleware-friendly

## Core Ideas

### 🧠 Simple, Explicit Code
No inner `Meta` classes. No hidden inheritance. Just clean Python code.

### 🚀 Async By Default
Built on ASGI, every route, middleware, and handler is `async def` by design.

### 🔐 Flexible Authentication
Supports:
- JWT (with rotation and optional blacklisting)
- API keys
- Custom auth backends (`BaseAuthBackend`)

### 📦 Built-in Tools, No Bloat
Includes:
- Auto docs
- JSON responses
- Request validation
- APIHandler (class-based views with hooks like `before_request`)

### 🧱 Inspired by Express.js
Declare routes fast:

```python
from nexios import get_application

app = get_application()

@app.get("/")
async def home(req):
    return {"message": "Hello, Nexios"}
````

No decorators for every detail. Minimal setup, maximum control.

## Use Cases

* Real-time apps (WebSockets support with Channels)
* Clean APIs with minimal stack
* Projects needing custom auth or logic
* Young devs or teams who hate Django magic ✨

> Nexios isn't trying to replace Django or FastAPI — it's giving you a new tool to ship clean, async apps **your way**.
